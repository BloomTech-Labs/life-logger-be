## Endpoints

#### Task Routes

| Method | Endpoint                                     | Access Control | Description                              |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/findById/user=:user_id/:task_id` | owners         | Get a task by `user_id` and task `id`    |
| GET    | `/api/tasks/findByUserId/:user_id`           | owners         | Get all tasks by `user_id`               |
| POST   | `/api/tasks/createTask`                      | owners         | Add a new events.                        |
| PUT    | `/api/tasks/updateTask/user=:user_id/:id`    | owners         | Update a task by `user_id` and task `id` |
| DELETE | `/api/tasks/deleteTask/user=:user_id/:id`    | owners         | Delete a task by `user_id` and task `id` |

All Task routes require an `authorization` header:

```
{
  authorizaton: {
    token: USER_TOKEN_HERE
  }
}
```

For creating a new task, the POST request for the `/api/tasks/createTask` endpoint requires the following body:

```
{
  "user_id": USER_ID,
  "task_name": TASK_NAME_AS_STRING,
  "category_name": "CATEGORY_NAME_AS_STRING,
  "due_date": DATETIME,
  "is_complete": BOOLEAN (optional, defaults to false),
  "all_day": BOOLEAN (optional, defaults to false),
  "task_notes": STRING (optional, defaults to null)
}
```

This endpoint will then search in the `task_names` table to see if the provided `task_name` already exists for that user. If not, it will also create a new entry in the `task_names` table. Likewise for the `category_name` in the `categories` table.

Return value upon successful task creation:

```
{
  id: TASK ID,
  user_id: USER_ID,
  category_id: CATEGORY_ID,
  task_id: TASK_ID (`id` from entry in `task_names` table),
  task_notes: STRING,
  all_day: BOOLEAN,
  is_complete: BOOLEAN,
  due_date: DATETIME
}
```

#### Users Routes

| Method | Endpoint             | Access Control | Description          |
| ------ | -------------------- | -------------- | -------------------- |
| POST   | `/api/auth/register` | all users      | Register a new user. |
| POST   | `/api/auth/login`    | all users      | Login                |
